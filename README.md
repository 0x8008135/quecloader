# Quecloader

# Installation
Simply add the checked-out git repository to your Ghidra-Scripts search paths.

# Usage
This script automatically loads a ThreadX user module extracted from a Quectel (such as BG96) according to its preamble.

* Open `Ghidra` >>> `CodeBrowser`
* Open the `ScriptManager` menu, search for `quecloader` and run it
* Provide the binary to be loaded
* Start reversing from `txm_module_preamble_start_function`

Note: FIDB can be generated by compiling examples available in the SDK provided by the manufacturer or [QuecOpen](https://github.com/quectel-wireless-solutions/QuecOpen)
